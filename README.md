***Well whattayaknow... me too!***

This module basically sits in the background and provides a quick, effortless way to make WebApps.

 - Launch the 'localhost:3333' URL in your default browser when starting? :heavy_check_mark:
 - Present a User-Friendly startup guide on first launch? :heavy_check_mark:
 - Hot-Reload on server & client code changes? :heavy_check_mark:
 - Serve files directly from your `/public` folder? :heavy_check_mark:
 - Compile front-end files with Webpack? :heavy_check_mark:
 - Include jQuery, lodash, Vue, socket.io, HowlerJS, and other goodies? :heavy_check_mark: :heavy_check_mark: :heavy_check_mark:

Why?
----

Simply because, overtime, I've noticed when I'm developing Web apps I'm rewriting the same code over and over, slightly differently, but usually behaving the same way in the end.

**Coming from a Flash background**, I've never been a big fan of writing `console.log`, so I generally make an alias to it with a global `trace` variable. You're welcome, fellow AS3 devs ;)
Quick Start
-----------

To get started, install it via `npm install @bigp/bigp-globals`

Once npm does its funky thing, you can start your app with a simple `app.js` file containing something like this:

```javascript
const $$$ = require('bigp-globals');

$$$.init()
  .then(status => trace(`Command returned: ${status}`.yellow))
  .catch(err => traceError(err));
```

Options
-------

You can configure the module by passing an **options** object to the `init({...})` method. Here is a list of what you can modify:

**Example**
```javascript
$$$.init({
  /////////// Yargs config:
  version: '2018.1.0',
  defaultCmd: 'auto',
  commands: {
    auto() {
      //Do something automatically...
      trace("No CLI command specified, running auto.");
      return 'auto';
    }
  },
  
  /////////// Express/Socket.IO config:
  server: {
  	port: 4444,
  	delay: 500,
  	isAutoStart: false,
  	isHelloWorld: true
  },
  
  /////////// Chokidar file-watcher config:
  watcher: {
  	dir: '/folder/to/keep/an/eye/on/'
  }
})
```

Here's the list of available options:
 - `noConflict` (Boolean, default=false) Prevents polluting the global-scope if true (will only write to `$$$.globals`).
 - `version`: (String) When starting the app from the command-line, using `-v` will display this version string.
 - `defaultCmd`: (String, default=auto) The default command to call in your list of commands when no command parameter is specified in the CLI `-c` (if no `commands` functions are provided, just uses the `built-in` one).
 - `commands`: (Object of functions) Provide a list of commands to perform custom startup processes depending on the `-c "command"` specified in the CLI.
 - `server`: **Express and Socket.IO config:**
   - `port`: (Number, default=3333) The port to listen on the Express web server.
   - `delay`: (Number, default=250) Milliseconds to wait before auto-starting the server.
   - `isAutoStart`: (Boolean, default=true) Tells the server to start immediately. If you need to configure other server-related parts of your app manually, you can set this to `false` and call `$$$.server.start()` after your setup code.
   - `isHelloWorld`: (Boolean, default=false) Serves a "Hello World" string on the root `/` URL.
   
 - `watcher`: **Chokidar file-watcher config:**
   - `dir`: (String, default=...) Path of root-folder to detect file modifications. By default, the root is your web-app's project directory.


> Hmm, I don't like the idea of polluting the global-scope.<br/>
(ex: having lodash `_` everywhere)

Easy fix, just set: ``$$$.init({noConflict: true})``

> What about those String, Number, Boolean, Array extensions?

Although `noConflict` takes care of some global conflicts,
there may be some extensions applied to the built-in Javascript types.
All I have to say about that is:
I really hope they won't conflict with your codebase, because they're designed to provide convenience methods used internally AND by the various web-apps created with this module. #BuiltInExtensionsLivesMatters, right? :grinning: 

The Promise of `$$$.init(...)`
-------------------------------
Once the module is initialized, it returns a Promise object.

The result passed in the resolved `then((result) => {...})` 
callback should be the *command* name passed with the `-c or --command` CLI argument.

You may want to add a `catch` callback as well to pickup any potential internal issues during startup / runtime.

Dependencies
------------

What it uses *under-the-hood*:

 - `express`: serves files from `/public` folders (the internal one, plus the one you define in your project) and can be used to create other Routers, your own REST API, etc.
 - `chokidar`: used to detect file-changes and hot-reload/restart the child-server process automatically.
 - `socket.io`: handles the Client-Server communication.
 - `yargs`: parses the CLI arguments when launching the server with special parameters.
